# Toxic Comment Detection Model

This project is designed to detect toxic comments in text data, particularly for **Twitter comments**. The model uses **deep learning techniques** to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic, helping to moderate online conversations by identifying harmful content.

## Overview
The **Toxic Comment Detection Model** is trained to classify comments into **toxic** and **non-toxic** categories. It uses a **deep learning model** built with popular Python libraries like **TensorFlow/Keras** for text processing and classification. This model was trained on **Twitter comment data** and provides a robust tool to identify harmful content.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for deep learning model)
- scikit-learn (for model evaluation)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn (for visualization)

### Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Binimose/toxic-comment-detection.git
cd toxic-comment-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements File
You can also create a `requirements.txt` with the following contents:
```
tensorflow
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, you can use the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will preprocess the **Twitter comment dataset**, build the model, and train it.

### Running Predictions
After training, you can use the trained model to predict toxicity in new comments. Here's an example of how to run predictions:

```bash
python predict.py "This is a sample toxic comment."
```

This will output whether the given comment is toxic or non-toxic.

### Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the model, use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

This will output evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Model Architecture
The model used for toxicity detection is based on a **deep neural network**. The key components are:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors for representation.
- **LSTM Layer**: Long Short-Term Memory networks are used to capture the sequential patterns in the text.
- **Dense Layer**: Fully connected layers to make the final prediction.

## Dataset
This model is trained on a **Twitter comments dataset**, which consists of labeled comments with toxic and non-toxic labels. You can find a similar dataset for training, or use your own labeled Twitter data.

For more information on the dataset, refer to the `data` folder in the repository.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set and metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** are reported. The model achieves a good balance between identifying toxic comments and minimizing false positives.

## Contributing
